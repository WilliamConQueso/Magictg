Life counter for magic the gathering

I will be trying my hand at learning the angular framework. This should be an easy first angular project. 

The site will run on a raspberry pi3b+ that I have.

What this simple site will consist of is:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript/jQuerry
node.js
nestJS
Angular
and potentially a mongoDB if people would like to register an account and leave a message.
